# Exercise 10: Create a new list from two list using the following condition

# Given:
# list1 = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]
# list2 = [40, 45, 60, 75, 90]

# Expected Output:
# result list: [25, 35, 40, 60, 90]

# Pseudocode
# assignning variable to two list
# assigning empty variable for result_list
# for loop with nested conditional to add the odd first list in result list
# another for loop with nested conditional to add the even second list in result list
# print result list
